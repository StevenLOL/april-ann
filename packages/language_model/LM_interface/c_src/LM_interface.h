   * The LMModel contains the 'static' (and usually thread-safe) data (e.g. the
   * actual automata, the MLPs of a NNLM, etc.) where as the LMInterface usually
   * contains other data structures to perform the actual computation of LM
   * queries.
   *
   * Two modes are available to query the language models:
   *
   * - One-by-one: get() based methods query the language model and store its
   *   result into an AprilUtils::vector.
   *
   * - Bunch-mode: insertQuery(), getQueries(), clearQueries() methods allow to
   *   list a bunch of queries into a temporary data structure using
   *   insertQuery() method, the language model computes its output in the
   *   getQueries() method, and finally the clearQueries() method allows to
   *   reset the temporary list of queries. This mode uses the LMInterface
   *   instance to store the state of the computation.
   *
   * @note Language models can be deterministic or not, therefore, this
   * interface methods produce lists of (key,score) pairs with @c size()>=0.
   *
   * @note In history based LMs this class contains a history manager, usually a
   * AprilUtils::TrieVector instance.

   * @note Score is usually AprilUtils::log_float.
